## Tasks:
1. Complete at least 10 challenges not including the tutorial ones.
2. If you feel you've already done the questions stated in the 'To-Solve' section, you are welcome to solve the additional problems. You have to complete a minimum of 10 of these problems however.
3. Writeups have to be submitted into your section of the repository.
4. Star the repository. You will need to fork it and commit changes that would reflect it into the main repository.
5. Learn about git and how to merge and create branches. Learning Git is very important for this challenge as well.
6. All these challenges will have to be completed before the starting of Week 3, with their writeups all going into the `Week 1` directory.
7. Structure your directories in this manner.
    ```
    your_name/WeekX/challenge_domain/files.md
    ```
    For example:
    ```
    Roonil03/Week1/ReverseEngineering/vault-door3.md
    ```
8. **DO NOT INTEREFERE WITH OTHER DIRECTORIES. IF FOUND, STRICT ACTION WILL BE TAKEN**
9. Please avoid using LLMs/tutorials to solve these problems. If you are finding something difficult, approach one of your mentors by writing on the group. We will direct and help you out. 
10. Week 2's content will be prepared in a similar fashion. If for some reason you were unable to complete solving the challenges given above, inform one of the mentors prior to the meeting for the week. Failure to do so will result in consequences unimaginable...
